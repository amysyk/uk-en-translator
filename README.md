# Ukrainian to English translator
Ukrainian to English translator powered by a pre-trained Helsinki-NLP model

## Goal
I wanted to see how difficult it is to build a translator with a pre-trained model. I also wanted to see how usable the translations would be when translating individual words, phrases, and poetry verses from Ukrainian to English, the two languages I am fluent in.

# Key learnings
* Building a basic translator takes barely 20 lines of code in Python.
* Individual word translations were relatively accurate even though my translator could not handle words with multiple meanings (e.g., table).
* Phrase translations were useful, but the translator didn't seem to take into account noun genders and other subtle information available in the Ukrainian phrases.
* Translations of a few poetry verses from "Marusya Churai" by Leena Kostenko were directionally accurate but lacked the emotional punch packed in the original verses.
